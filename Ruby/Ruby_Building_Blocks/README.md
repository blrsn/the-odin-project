## Caesar Cipher

[caesar.rb](https://github.com/larson004/the-odin-project/blob/master/Ruby/Ruby_Building_Blocks/ceasar.rb)

Implement a caesar cipher that takes in a string and the shift factor and then outputs the modified string:

```ruby
> caesar_cipher("What a string!", 5)
    => "Bmfy f xywnsl!"
```

## Stock Picker

[stocks.rb](https://github.com/larson004/the-odin-project/blob/master/Ruby/Ruby_Building_Blocks/stockpicker.rb)

Implement a method #stock_picker that takes in an array of stock prices, one for each hypothetical day. It should return a pair of days representing the best day to buy and the best day to sell. Days start at 0.

```ruby
> stock_picker([17,3,6,9,15,8,6,1,10])
    => [1,4]  # for a profit of $15 - $3 == $12
```

## Substrings

[substrings.rb](https://github.com/larson004/the-odin-project/blob/master/Ruby/Ruby_Building_Blocks/substrings.rb)

Implement a method #substrings that takes a word as the first argument and then an array of valid substrings (your dictionary) as the second argument. It should return a hash listing each substring (case insensitive) that was found in the original string and how many times it was found.

```ruby
> dictionary = ["below","down","go","going","horn","how","howdy","it","i","low","own","part","partner","sit"]
    => ["below","down","go","going","horn","how","howdy","it","i","low","own","part","partner","sit"]

> substrings("below", dictionary)
    => {"below"=>1, "low"=>1}
```

Next, make sure your method can handle multiple words:

```ruby
> substrings("Howdy partner, sit down! How's it going?", dictionary)
    => {"down"=>1, "how"=>2, "howdy"=>1,"go"=>1, "going"=>1, "it"=>2, "i"=> 3, "own"=>1,"part"=>1,"partner"=>1,"sit"=>1}
```
