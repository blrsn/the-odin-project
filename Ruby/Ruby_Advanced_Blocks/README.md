## Bubble Sort

[bubble_sort.rb](https://github.com/larson004/the-odin-project/blob/master/Ruby/Ruby_Advanced_Blocks/bubble_sort/bubble_sort.rb)

Build a method #bubble_sort that takes an array and returns a sorted array. It must use the bubble sort methodology (using #sort would be pretty pointless, wouldn't it?).

```ruby
> bubble_sort([4,3,78,2,0,2])
    => [0,2,2,3,4,78]
```

## Bubble Sort By

[bubble_sort_by.rb](https://github.com/larson004/the-odin-project/blob/master/Ruby/Ruby_Advanced_Blocks/bubble_sort/bubble_sort_by.rb)

Now create a similar method called #bubble_sort_by which sorts an array but accepts a block. The block should take two arguments which represent the two elements currently being compared. Expect that the block's return will be similar to the spaceship operator you learned about before -- if the result of the block is negative, the element on the left is "smaller" than the element on the right. 0 means they are equal. A positive result means the right element is greater. Use this to sort your array.

```ruby
> bubble_sort_by(["hi","hello","hey"]) do |left,right|
>   right.length - left.length
> end
	=> ["hi", "hey", "hello"]
```

## Enumerable Methods

[enumerables.rb](https://github.com/larson004/the-odin-project/blob/master/Ruby/Ruby_Advanced_Blocks/enumerables.rb)

You learned about the Enumerable module that gets mixed in to the Array and Hash classes (among others) and provides you with lots of handy iterator methods. To prove that there's no magic to it, you're going to rebuild those methods.

1. Create a script file to house your methods and run it in IRB to test them later.

2. Add your new methods onto the existing Enumerable module. Ruby makes this easy for you because any class or module can be added to without trouble ... just do something like:

```ruby
module Enumerable
  def my_each
    # your code here
  end
end
```

3. Create `#my_each`, a method that is identical to `#each` but (obviously) does not use `#each`. You'll need to remember the yield statement. Make sure it returns the same thing as `#each` as well.

4. Create `#my_each_with_index` in the same way.

5. Create `#my_select` in the same way, though you may use `#my_each` in your definition (but not `#each`).

6. Create `#my_all?` (continue as above)

7. Create `#my_any?`

8. Create `#my_none?`

9. Create `#my_count`

10. Create `#my_map`

11. Create `#my_inject`

12. Test your `#my_inject` by creating a method called `#multiply_els` which multiplies all the elements of the array together by using `#my_inject`, e.g. `multiply_els([2,4,5]) #=> 40`

13. Modify your `#my_map` method to take a proc instead.

14. Modify your `#my_map` method to take either a proc or a block, executing the block only if both are supplied (in which case it would execute both the block AND the proc).
